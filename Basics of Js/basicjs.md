## 1. Function Expression vs Function Declaration

Let's formulate the key differences between Function Declarations and Expressions.

First, the syntax: how to differentiate between them in the code.

- *Function Declaration:* a function, declared as a separate statement, in the main code flow:

    ```js
    // Function Declaration
    function sum(a, b) {
      return a + b;
    }
    ```
- *Function Expression:* a function, created inside an expression or inside another syntax construct. Here, the function is created on the right side of the "assignment expression" `=`:

    ```js
    // Function Expression
    let sum = function(a, b) {
      return a + b;
    };
    ```

The more subtle difference is *when* a function is created by the JavaScript engine.

**A Function Expression is created when the execution reaches it and is usable only from that moment.**

Once the execution flow passes to the right side of the assignment `let sum = function…` -- here we go, the function is created and can be used (assigned, called, etc. ) from now on.

Function Declarations are different.

**A Function Declaration can be called earlier than it is defined.**

For example, a global Function Declaration is visible in the whole script, no matter where it is.

That's due to internal algorithms. When JavaScript prepares to run the script, it first looks for global Function Declarations in it and creates the functions. We can think of it as an "initialization stage".

And after all Function Declarations are processed, the code is executed. So it has access to these functions.

For example, this works:

```js run refresh untrusted
*!*
sayHi("John"); // Hello, John
*/!*

function sayHi(name) {
  alert( `Hello, ${name}` );
}
```

The Function Declaration `sayHi` is created when JavaScript is preparing to start the script and is visible everywhere in it.

...If it were a Function Expression, then it wouldn't work:

```js run refresh untrusted
*!*
sayHi("John"); // error!
*/!*

let sayHi = function(name) {  // (*) no magic any more
  alert( `Hello, ${name}` );
};
```

Function Expressions are created when the execution reaches them. That would happen only in the line `(*)`. Too late.

Another special feature of Function Declarations is their block scope.

**In strict mode, when a Function Declaration is within a code block, it's visible everywhere inside that block. But not outside of it.**

For instance, let's imagine that we need to declare a function `welcome()` depending on the `age` variable that we get during runtime. And then we plan to use it some time later.

If we use Function Declaration, it won't work as intended:

```js run
let age = prompt("What is your age?", 18);

// conditionally declare a function
if (age < 18) {

  function welcome() {
    alert("Hello!");
  }

} else {

  function welcome() {
    alert("Greetings!");
  }

}

// ...use it later
*!*
welcome(); // Error: welcome is not defined
*/!*
```

That's because a Function Declaration is only visible inside the code block in which it resides.

Here's another example:

```js run
let age = 16; // take 16 as an example

if (age < 18) {
*!*
  welcome();               // \   (runs)
*/!*
                           //  |
  function welcome() {     //  |
    alert("Hello!");       //  |  Function Declaration is available
  }                        //  |  everywhere in the block where it's declared
                           //  |
*!*
  welcome();               // /   (runs)
*/!*

} else {

  function welcome() {
    alert("Greetings!");
  }
}

// Here we're out of curly braces,
// so we can not see Function Declarations made inside of them.

*!*
welcome(); // Error: welcome is not defined
*/!*
```

What can we do to make `welcome` visible outside of `if`?

The correct approach would be to use a Function Expression and assign `welcome` to the variable that is declared outside of `if` and has the proper visibility.

This code works as intended:

```js run
let age = prompt("What is your age?", 18);

let welcome;

if (age < 18) {

  welcome = function() {
    alert("Hello!");
  };

} else {

  welcome = function() {
    alert("Greetings!");
  };

}

*!*
welcome(); // ok now
*/!*
```

Or we could simplify it even further using a question mark operator `?`:

```js run
let age = prompt("What is your age?", 18);

let welcome = (age < 18) ?
  function() { alert("Hello!"); } :
  function() { alert("Greetings!"); };

*!*
welcome(); // ok now
*/!*
```


```smart header="When to choose Function Declaration versus Function Expression?"
As a rule of thumb, when we need to declare a function, the first thing to consider is Function Declaration syntax. It gives more freedom in how to organize our code, because we can call such functions before they are declared.

That's also better for readability, as it's easier to look up `function f(…) {…}` in the code than `let f = function(…) {…};`. Function Declarations are more "eye-catching".

...But if a Function Declaration does not suit us for some reason, or we need a conditional declaration (we've just seen an example), then Function Expression should be used.
```

## Summary

- Functions are values. They can be assigned, copied or declared in any place of the code.
- If the function is declared as a separate statement in the main code flow, that's called a "Function Declaration".
- If the function is created as a part of an expression, it's called a "Function Expression".
- Function Declarations are processed before the code block is executed. They are visible everywhere in the block.
- Function Expressions are created when the execution flow reaches them.

In most cases when we need to declare a function, a Function Declaration is preferable, because it is visible prior to the declaration itself. That gives us more flexibility in code organization, and is usually more readable.

So we should use a Function Expression only when a Function Declaration is not fit for the task. We've seen a couple of examples of that in this chapter, and will see more in the future.
