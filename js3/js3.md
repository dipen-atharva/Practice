# Property flags and descriptors


As we know, objects can store properties.

Until now, a property was a simple "key-value" pair to us. But an object property is actually a more flexible and powerful thing.

In this chapter we'll study additional configuration options, and in the next we'll see how to invisibly turn them into getter/setter functions.

## Property flags

Object properties, besides a **`value`**, have three special attributes (so-called "flags"):

- **`writable`** -- if `true`, the value can be changed, otherwise it's read-only.
- **`enumerable`** -- if `true`, then listed in loops, otherwise not listed.
- **`configurable`** -- if `true`, the property can be deleted and these attributes can be modified, otherwise not.

We didn't see them yet, because generally they do not show up. When we create a property "the usual way", all of them are `true`. But we also can change them anytime.

First, let's see how to get those flags.

The method [Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/getOwnPropertyDescriptor) allows to query the *full* information about a property.

The syntax is:
```js
let descriptor = Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(obj, propertyName);
```

`obj`
: The object to get information from.

`propertyName`
: The name of the property.

The returned value is a so-called "property descriptor" object: it contains the value and all the flags.

For instance:

```js run
let user = {
  name: "John"
};

let descriptor = Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(user, 'name');

alert( JSON.stringify(descriptor, null, 2 ) );
/* property descriptor:
{
  "value": "John",
  "writable": true,
  "enumerable": true,
  "configurable": true
}
*/
```

To change the flags, we can use [Object.defineProperty](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/defineProperty).

The syntax is:

```js
Object.defineProperty(obj, propertyName, descriptor)
```

`obj`, `propertyName`
: The object and its property to apply the descriptor.

`descriptor`
: Property descriptor object to apply.

If the property exists, `defineProperty` updates its flags. Otherwise, it creates the property with the given value and flags; in that case, if a flag is not supplied, it is assumed `false`.

For instance, here a property `name` is created with all falsy flags:

```js run
let user = {};

*!*
Object.defineProperty(user, "name", {
  value: "John"
});
*/!*

let descriptor = Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(user, 'name');

alert( JSON.stringify(descriptor, null, 2 ) );
/*
{
  "value": "John",
*!*
  "writable": false,
  "enumerable": false,
  "configurable": false
*/!*
}
 */
```

Compare it with "normally created" `user.name` above: now all flags are falsy. If that's not what we want then we'd better set them to `true` in `descriptor`.

Now let's see effects of the flags by example.

## Non-writable

Let's make `user.name` non-writable (can't be reassigned) by changing `writable` flag:

```js run
let user = {
  name: "John"
};

Object.defineProperty(user, "name", {
*!*
  writable: false
*/!*
});

*!*
user.name = "Pete"; // Error: Cannot assign to read only property 'name'
*/!*
```

Now no one can change the name of our user, unless they apply their own `defineProperty` to override ours.

```smart header="Errors appear only in strict mode"
In non-strict mode, no errors occur when writing to non-writable properties and such. But the operation still won't succeed. Flag-violating actions are just silently ignored in non-strict.
```

Here's the same example, but the property is created from scratch:

```js run
let user = { };

Object.defineProperty(user, "name", {
*!*
  value: "John",
  // for new properties we need to explicitly list what's true
  enumerable: true,
  configurable: true
*/!*
});

alert(user.name); // John
user.name = "Pete"; // Error
```

## Non-enumerable

Now let's add a custom `toString` to `user`.

Normally, a built-in `toString` for objects is non-enumerable, it does not show up in `for..in`. But if we add a `toString` of our own, then by default it shows up in `for..in`, like this:

```js run
let user = {
  name: "John",
  toString() {
    return this.name;
  }
};

// By default, both our properties are listed:
for (let key in user) alert(key); // name, toString
```

If we don't like it, then we can set `enumerable:false`. Then it won't appear in a `for..in` loop, just like the built-in one:

```js run
let user = {
  name: "John",
  toString() {
    return this.name;
  }
};

Object.defineProperty(user, "toString", {
*!*
  enumerable: false
*/!*
});

*!*
// Now our toString disappears:
*/!*
for (let key in user) alert(key); // name
```

Non-enumerable properties are also excluded from `Object.keys`:

```js
alert(Object.keys(user)); // name
```

## Non-configurable

The non-configurable flag (`configurable:false`) is sometimes preset for built-in objects and properties.

A non-configurable property can't be deleted, its attributes can't be modified.

For instance, `Math.PI` is non-writable, non-enumerable and non-configurable:

```js run
let descriptor = Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(Math, 'PI');

alert( JSON.stringify(descriptor, null, 2 ) );
/*
{
  "value": 3.141592653589793,
  "writable": false,
  "enumerable": false,
  "configurable": false
}
*/
```
So, a programmer is unable to change the value of `Math.PI` or overwrite it.

```js run
Math.PI = 3; // Error, because it has writable: false

// delete Math.PI won't work either
```

We also can't change `Math.PI` to be `writable` again:

```js run
// Error, because of configurable: false
Object.defineProperty(Math, "PI", { writable: true });
```

There's absolutely nothing we can do with `Math.PI`.

Making a property non-configurable is a one-way road. We cannot change it back with `defineProperty`.

**Please note: `configurable: false` prevents changes of property flags and its deletion, while allowing to change its value.**

Here `user.name` is non-configurable, but we can still change it (as it's writable):

```js run
let user = {
  name: "John"
};

Object.defineProperty(user, "name", {
  configurable: false
});

user.name = "Pete"; // works fine
delete user.name; // Error
```

And here we make `user.name` a "forever sealed" constant, just like the built-in `Math.PI`:

```js run
let user = {
  name: "John"
};

Object.defineProperty(user, "name", {
  writable: false,
  configurable: false
});

// won't be able to change user.name or its flags
// all this won't work:
user.name = "Pete";
delete user.name;
Object.defineProperty(user, "name", { value: "Pete" });
```

```smart header="The only attribute change possible: writable true -> false"
There's a minor exception about changing flags.

We can change `writable: true` to `false` for a non-configurable property, thus preventing its value modification (to add another layer of protection). Not the other way around though.
```

## Object.defineProperties

There's a method [Object.defineProperties(obj, descriptors)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/defineProperties) that allows to define many properties at once.

The syntax is:

```js
Object.defineProperties(obj, {
  prop1: descriptor1,
  prop2: descriptor2
  // ...
});
```

For instance:

```js
Object.defineProperties(user, {
  name: { value: "John", writable: false },
  surname: { value: "Smith", writable: false },
  // ...
});
```

So, we can set many properties at once.

## Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptors

To get all property descriptors at once, we can use the method [Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptors(obj)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/getOwnPropertyDescriptors).

Together with `Object.defineProperties` it can be used as a "flags-aware" way of cloning an object:

```js
let clone = Object.defineProperties({}, Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptors(obj));
```

Normally when we clone an object, we use an assignment to copy properties, like this:

```js
for (let key in user) {
  clone[key] = user[key]
}
```

...But that does not copy flags. So if we want a "better" clone then `Object.defineProperties` is preferred.

Another difference is that `for..in` ignores symbolic and non-enumerable properties, but `Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptors` returns *all* property descriptors including symbolic and non-enumerable ones.

# Prototypal inheritance

In programming, we often want to take something and extend it.

For instance, we have a `user` object with its properties and methods, and want to make `admin` and `guest` as slightly modified variants of it. We'd like to reuse what we have in `user`, not copy/reimplement its methods, just build a new object on top of it.

*Prototypal inheritance* is a language feature that helps in that.

## [[Prototype]]

In JavaScript, objects have a special hidden property `[[Prototype]]` (as named in the specification), that is either `null` or references another object. That object is called "a prototype":

The property `[[Prototype]]` is internal and hidden, but there are many ways to set it.

One of them is to use the special name `__proto__`, like this:

```js run
let animal = {
  eats: true
};
let rabbit = {
  jumps: true
};

*!*
rabbit.__proto__ = animal; // sets rabbit.[[Prototype]] = animal
*/!*
```
So if `animal` has a lot of useful properties and methods, then they become automatically available in `rabbit`. Such properties are called "inherited".

If we have a method in `animal`, it can be called on `rabbit`:

```js run
let animal = {
  eats: true,
*!*
  walk() {
    alert("Animal walk");
  }
*/!*
};

let rabbit = {
  jumps: true,
  __proto__: animal
};

// walk is taken from the prototype
*!*
rabbit.walk(); // Animal walk
*/!*
```

The method is automatically taken from the prototype, like this:

The prototype chain can be longer:

```js run
let animal = {
  eats: true,
  walk() {
    alert("Animal walk");
  }
};

let rabbit = {
  jumps: true,
*!*
  __proto__: animal
*/!*
};

let longEar = {
  earLength: 10,
*!*
  __proto__: rabbit
*/!*
};

// walk is taken from the prototype chain
longEar.walk(); // Animal walk
alert(longEar.jumps); // true (from rabbit)
```


## Writing doesn't use prototype

The prototype is only used for reading properties.

Write/delete operations work directly with the object.

In the example below, we assign its own `walk` method to `rabbit`:

```js run
let animal = {
  eats: true,
  walk() {
    /* this method won't be used by rabbit */  
  }
};

let rabbit = {
  __proto__: animal
};

*!*
rabbit.walk = function() {
  alert("Rabbit! Bounce-bounce!");
};
*/!*

rabbit.walk(); // Rabbit! Bounce-bounce!
```

From now on, `rabbit.walk()` call finds the method immediately in the object and executes it, without using the prototype:


Accessor properties are an exception, as assignment is handled by a setter function. So writing to such a property is actually the same as calling a function.

For that reason `admin.fullName` works correctly in the code below:

```js run
let user = {
  name: "John",
  surname: "Smith",

  set fullName(value) {
    [this.name, this.surname] = value.split(" ");
  },

  get fullName() {
    return `${this.name} ${this.surname}`;
  }
};

let admin = {
  __proto__: user,
  isAdmin: true
};

alert(admin.fullName); // John Smith (*)

// setter triggers!
admin.fullName = "Alice Cooper"; // (**)

alert(admin.fullName); // Alice Cooper, state of admin modified
alert(user.fullName); // John Smith, state of user protected
```

Here in the line `(*)` the property `admin.fullName` has a getter in the prototype `user`, so it is called. And in the line `(**)` the property has a setter in the prototype, so it is called.




- In JavaScript, all objects have a hidden `[[Prototype]]` property that's either another object or `null`.
- We can use `obj.__proto__` to access it (a historical getter/setter, there are other ways, to be covered soon).
- The object referenced by `[[Prototype]]` is called a "prototype".
- If we want to read a property of `obj` or call a method, and it doesn't exist, then JavaScript tries to find it in the prototype.
- Write/delete operations act directly on the object, they don't use the prototype (assuming it's a data property, not a setter).
- If we call `obj.method()`, and the `method` is taken from the prototype, `this` still references `obj`. So methods always work with the current object even if they are inherited.
- The `for..in` loop iterates over both its own and its inherited pr
